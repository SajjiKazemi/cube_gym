# CubeGym Environment for Training an RL Agent to Find the Optimal Path

This repository contains the code for the CubeGym environment. The environment includes a cube of
an arbitrary size which is divided into several smaller, the same-size, cubes, as can be seen
in the following figure. Several cells are occupied by obstacles, restricting the agentâ€™s ability to pass
through them. We proceed with the assumption that the obstacles remain stationary and
do not undergo any relocation.
At every state, the agent has five potential movements: up, down, left, right, and forward.
We make the assumption that these transitions are certain.
Any of the above-mentioned characteristics can be changed!
